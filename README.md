#Project Description:
The Recommendation Letter Generator system is designed to integrate the overall process of requesting and creating recommendation letters for students. After the completion of their final year, there is a significant number of students applying to foreign Universities for higher education, and professors are faced with a massive influx of recommendation letter requests. This causes significant delay in accommodating the student requests, so our recommendation letter generator system tries to solve this problem by creating a common portal for both students and professors, whereby students can request a professor by providing the appropriate credentials and resume. Then for professors, our portal provides an organized list of all pending student requests, and then the professors can easily create recommendation letters for the students.

In our system, there are mainly three types of roles that a user will have:
1. Admin: Administrators are those who are responsible for the maintenance of the system, they have privileges of managing the other user's accounts and handling their data. They are capable of adding teachers and modifying the studentâ€™s information.

2. Teacher: Teachers are the ones who provide the recommendation letters in response to requests from students. Our portal provides the teachers with an organized list of all student requests along with accompanying pieces of information such as their CV, extra-curricular-activities, scholastic achievements, and any other such relevant information, the teachers can then choose from a list of options in our intuitive form and create custom recommendation letters for students.
   
3. Student:Students are the ones making requests to teachers for recommendation letters, upon registering into our portal and creating an account, the students provide all the relevant information such as their faculty, department, professors they have studied from, and the names of projects or any other extra activities they have been involved with during their time in college. Then, they can request one of the teachers for a recommendation letter.
